                <strong>BoomBox!</strong> started on 1 Januari 2010 as physical music store in Yogyakarta. As the year reach 2020 and contemporary streaming platform starting to give less and less penny to artist, BoomBox! thought what can we do in these trying times as artist and as music enjoyer?

                In seach of an answer, we try to find something simple that can unite artists and music enjoyer. Yup, music. That was when we remember the name of our store: BoomBox. A music player. How about we try to fly a little higher and farther? At least on local scene?
            </p>
            <p>
                With that in mind, BoomBox try to develop a healty ecosystem where artists can thrive and live from their art, and fans can experience the art in their chosen format with the highest quality possible while still supporting the artist and saving money.
